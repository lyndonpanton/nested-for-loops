# nested-for-loops
Exercise 9 for the "More C# Programming and Unity" course of the "C# Programming for Unity Game Development Specialization" by the University of Colorado via Coursera

## Description

Problem 1 – Print rows of asterisks that are a user-specified width

Create a new Console Application named Exercise9.

Prompt for and get a row width from the user.

Prompt for and get a number of rows from the user.

Print the appropriate number of rows of asterisks, with each row the user-specified row width.

For example, if the user enters 3 for the number of rows and 5 for the row width, your program should output:

*****

*****

*****

Note: The Coursera formatting makes it look like there's a blank line between each row of asterisks above, but there isn't. Your output for the given example should be exactly 3 lines of asterisks of width 5.

Hint: You need to use nested loops in your solution

Problem 2 – Print rows of asterisks up to user-specified max width

Prompt for and get a row width from the user.

Print rows of asterisks, adding 1 to the asterisk in each row, until you print a row of the user-specified row width.

For example, if the user enters 5 your program should output:

*

**
